# Minor_Project_2
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Behavioral Pattern Recognition using text datasets. It utilizes machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify and evaluate emotional states such as Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, and more.



#Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze human sentiment and behavior by processing textual data and mapping it to emotional categories. Each emotion is assigned a unique key value, which helps in quantifying and interpreting the sentiment behind the input text. The model then predicts and outputs the dominant emotion, offering insight into user behavior.


#Core Features:

1.Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.

2.Behavior Analysis: Quantifies emotional patterns based on key-value mappings.

3.Dataset Driven: Trained and tested on well-structured emotion-labeled datasets.

4.Visual Results : Can be extended to visualize emotional trends in datasets or user inputs.


#Applications:

1.Social media sentiment tracking

2.Mental health support systems

3.Customer feedback analysis

4.Educational and learning behavior modeling
